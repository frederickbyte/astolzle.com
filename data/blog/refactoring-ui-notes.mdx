## Overview

Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan, creators of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), have compiled an eBook of tips and tricks for improving user interfaces called [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com). I've plucked out some notes that are of particular interest to me.

## Foundational Principles


### Start with features, not layouts

Applications are collections of *features*. Until we design those features, we do not have the requisite information to even begin designing a layout! Developers and designers find frustration when starting a new project because they put the cart before the horse -- *they begin with layouts instead of features*.

Begin with functionality rather than with the layout shell. Designing pages is easier if you know the functionality. Doing so will prevent you from over-complicating the layout with unnecessary elements.

### Focus on the forest, then worry about the trees

Do not get hung up making decisions regarding typefaces or icons before you‚Äôve settled on a wireframe or shell. Details come later.

Schoger suggests designing your application in grayscale so that your focus is on the layout rather than with the intricate details. Schoger says:

> By designing in grayscale, you‚Äôre forced to use spacing, contrast, and size to do all of the heavy lifting‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a little more challenging, but you‚Äôll end up with a clearer interface with a strong hierarchy that‚Äôs easy to enhance with color later.


Focusing on the forest allows you to iterate quickly during the design process. Doing so affords the opportunity to explore new ideas without delaying the development of your application. Like software development, *working in cycles* when designing an app makes catching problems or inconsistencies far easier.

### Keep it simple (do not over-design)

It is best practice **not to** design every aspect of an application before implementation. What constitutes as ‚Äúover-designing‚Äù depends on the complexity of the application. Over-designing Facebook is far different from over-designing a simple ‚Äúto-do‚Äù app. But there is a *relationship* (or ratio) between your application complexity and the amount of time/detail you should allocate toward the design.

When designing new features, **expect them to be hard to build**. Focus on the minimum viable product (MVP) and leave the ‚Äúnice to have" features for later iterations. Build the simple version first.

**Limit your choices** when designing your application. Including too many colors or fonts may paralyze you or cause you to create an inconsistent app. Try *defining your systems in advance* so that you are not stuck tweaking pixels or reaching for the color picker over and over again. Doing so will ensure a more consistent design that your users will appreciate.

Defining systems up-front simplifies downstream design decisions and limits mental fatigue that may creep in if things are not organized.

  </div>

   What type of application are you creating? Do you want to communicate a professional vibe or do you want your app to be playful?

### Font choice

1. *Serif* fonts for elegant, classic look and feel
2. *Rounded sans-serif* fonts for playful, fun look due to the rounded nature of the font family
3. *Neutral sans-serif* for a more plain look

### Color

There is an entire field of psychology devoted to color. Without delving into that deep field, here are a few rules of thumb:


- <span style={{ color: `var(--pastel-blue-color)`, fontWeight: '600' }}>Blue</span> is safe, familiar, and popular
- <span style={{ color: `var(--pastel-orange-color)`, fontWeight: '600' }}>Gold</span> may communicate sophistication and elegance
- <span style={{ color: `var(--darkened-pink-color)`, fontWeight: '600' }}>Pink</span> may appear more playful and fun

Ultimately, you want to choose colors that fit with your design philosophy and with what your application is aiming to communicate to its audience.

### Border radius

Although it may seem insignificant, your application‚Äôs border radii communicate a specific look and feel. A few notes:

- *smaller radii* are neutral
- *larger radii* may feel less serious
- *no radii* may feel serious and professional

Regardless of which radii you choose ‚Äî **stay consistent**. Inconsistent border radii may look ugly and unpolished to your app users.

### Verbiage (word choice)

Verbal tone and word choice also factor into how professional or playful your application is.

### Utilize process of elimination

Eliminating obviously bad choices when designing will simplify the process and increase the speed at which you can iterate your designs.

## Hierarchy

*Visual hierarchy* refers to how elements in an interface relate to one another. Good or bad, all websites have some form of visual hierarchy. Many sites lack organization -- components compete with each other for attention which creates a noisy, cluttered interface.

### Use weight and color to convey importance

Relying on size to control importance can lead to a bloated interface where elements are far larger or smaller than they should be. Try incorporating various colors, font weights, and shadows to create a visual hierarchy. A few tips:


- make primary elements **bold** (greater font weight such as 600 or 700)
- make secondary elements softer in color or add some transparency to indicate lower importance

Color is another great tool. We can use:


- dark color for primary content (titles)
- grey color for secondary content (subtitles or headings)
- lighter grey for tertiary content (asides or footers)

### Button hierarchy tips

For **primary** buttons, use solid backgrounds to indicate that the button is most important or consequential on the page. You should strive to limit each page to *one primary action* to simplify things for the user.

For **secondary** buttons, use an outlined style and refrain from using solid backgrounds to prevent a  collision with the primary action. Doing so will communicate that this action is less important or consequential than the primary action.

Fro **tertiary** actions, style buttons as if they are hyperlinks or a basic clickable element. Do not draw much attention to these elements but make sure to visual signify to users that they are indeed clickable.
